shared code
The answer 3 and 4 file is the same as the files I sent to you yesterday.
The Data Analyst Exercise 201408_trip_data file in the email is the csv dataset that I used for the analysis - shared bicycle, you can download it and change the read_csv code in the Analysis - shared bicycle file, which is trip = pd.read_csv('C:/Users/yzzhj/Desktop/zjy/data PTA/Data Analyst Exercise 201408_trip_data.csv'), to your own file location so that you can run the upload the csv file and then run the code.
The Analysis - shared bicycle file is one of my past project code. You can download it and open with Jupyter Notebook if you want to run it by yourself.
